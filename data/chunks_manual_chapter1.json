Usually only one general type of valve was considered, a sliding-stem valve. Each manufacturer offered a product suitable for the job, and the choice among them depended upon such obvious matters as cost, delivery, vendor relationships and user preference.\n\nToday, control valve selection is considerably more complex, especially for engineers with limited experience or those who have not kept up with changes in the control valve industry.\n\nFor many applications, an assortment of slidingstem and rotary valve styles are available. Some are touted as \"universal\" valves for almost any size and service, while others are claimed to be optimum solutions for narrowly defined needs. Even the most knowledgeable user may wonder whether they are really getting the most for their money in the control valves they have been specifying.\n\nLike most decisions, selection of a control valve involves a great number of variables. Presented here is an overview of the selection process. The discussion includes categorization of available valve types and a set of criteria to be considered in the selection process.\n\n",

Globe, angle, and Y-pattern valves can be purchased in sizes ranging from NPS 1/236. More choices of materials, end connections and control characteristics are included here than in any other product family.\n\nGlobe valves are available in cage-guided, postguided and stem-guided designs, with flanged, screwed or weld ends. Economical cast iron as well as carbon steel, stainless steel and other high-performance body materials are available. Available valve body pressure ratings range to ASME CL4500 or API 10,000.\n\nThe globe valve's precise throttling capabilities, overall performance and general sturdiness make them a bargain despite their slight cost premium. With the globe valve, the buyer gets a rugged, dependable unit intended for long, trouble-free service.\n\nSliding-stem valves are ruggedly built to handle field conditions such as piping stress, vibration, and temperature changes. In sizes through NPS 3 -4 , incremental costs over rotary valves are low in contrast to the increments in benefits received.\n\nFor many extreme service conditions, sliding-stem valves are the only suitable choice. These situations include high pressures and temperatures, excessive noise, and the potential for cavitation. Due to process demands, these applications require the rugged construction of the sliding-stem design.\n\nBarstock valves are small, economical slidingstem valves featuring bodies machined from bar stock. Body sizes range from fractions of NPS 1 3; flow capacities generally are lower than those of general purpose valves. End connections usually are flangeless (for mounting between piping flanges) or screwed.\n\nThe main advantage of the barstock valve is that far more materials are readily available in bar form than in cast form. Consequently, these valves are often used where there are special corrosion considerations.\n\nAlso, the compactness and general high-quality construction of barstock valves make them attractive for low flow rate applications. Overall, they are an economical choice when they can be used.\n\n[Figure figure_1_4]\n\n[Figure figure_1_5]\n\nThe third subcategory, which involves the lowest cost products among sliding-stem valves, utilizes \"economy\" bodies (Figure 1-5). These valves are used for low-pressure steam, air and water applications that are not demanding. Sizes available range from NPS 1/2-4. Body materials include bronze, cast iron, steel and SST. Pressure classes generally stop at ASME CL300. Compared to regular sliding-stem valves, these units are very simple; their actuators are smaller, and their construc-\n\n[Figure figure_1_6]\n\n[Figure figure_1_7]\ntion is economical.

The through-bore or full-ball type illustrated in Figure 1-6 is used typically for high pressure drop throttling and on-off applications in sizes to NPS 24. Full port designs exhibit high flow capacity and low susceptibility to wear by erosive streams. However, sluggish flow response in the first 20\\% of ball travel may make full-bore ball valves unsuitable for some throttling applications.\n\nAnother popular kind of ball valve is the seg-mented-ball style (Figure 1-7). This subcategory utilizes a reduced bore, and the edge of the ball segment has a contoured notch shape for better throttling control and higher rangeability. Intended primarily for modulating service, segmented-ball valves are generally higher in overall control performance than full-ball products.\n\nSegmented-ball valves with their splined shaft connections are engineered to eliminate lost motion, which is detrimental to performance. The use of heavy-duty metal and fluoroplastic sealing elements allows wide temperature and fluid applicability. Their straight-through flow design achieves high capacity with sizes ranging through NPS 24 and pressure ratings to ASME CL600.

      "page_content": "\\section*{Eccentric Plug Valves}\n\nThis class of valves combines many features of sliding-stem and rotary products. Eccentric plug valves feature rotary actuation. But, unlike most rotary valves, this product utilizes a massive, rigid seat design.\n\nEccentric-plug valves (Figure 1-8) exhibit excellent throttling capability and resistance to erosion. Thus, many of the good aspects of both rotary and sliding-stem designs are combined.\n\nSizes generally range through NPS 8; pressure ratings go to ASME CL600. Both flanged and flangeless body styles are available in a variety of materials.\n\nThe requirement for zero or low leakage gave rise to new designs such as the lined and high performance butterfly valves (BFV's).\n\nLined butterfly valves feature an elastomer or fluoropolymer (TFE) lining that contacts the disk to provide tight shutoff. Since this valve design depends on interference between the disc and liner for shutoff, it is more limited in pressure drop. Temperature ranges typically are limited due to the elastomer disk seal.\n\nIn addition to serving as the disk seal, the liner also protects the inner bore of the valve body from the process fluid, which allows these valves to be used in many corrosive situations. Elastomer-lined BFV's are generally the lowest price products available as control valves in medium to large sizes.\n\nHeavy shafts and discs, full-rated bodies and sophisticated seals that allow tight shutoff against high pressures characterize high performance but-\n\n[Figure figure_1_9]\nterfly valves such as the one in Figure 1-9. These valves provide an excellent combination of performance features, lightweight and very reasonable pricing.\n\nIn offset disc designs, eccentric shaft mounting allows the valve disc to swing clear of its seal to minimize wear and torque. The offset disc allows uninterrupted sealing and a seal ring that can be replaced without removing the disc. High performance butterfly valves come in sizes from NPS 2 through NPS 72, with flangeless, lugged, double flanged connections, carbon steel or stainless steel bodies, and pressure ratings to ASME CL2500. Tight metal-to-metal seals, made possible with advanced eccentric design, provide tight shutoff in applications that are too hot for elastomer lined valves. Considering this tight shutoff capability and heavy-duty construction, high performance butterfly valves can be a suitable option to many applications where sliding-stem valves are normally specified.\n\n",

The considerations include the strength or ductility of the body material as well as relative thermal expansion of various parts.\n\nTemperature limits also may be imposed due to disintegration of soft parts at high temperatures or\nloss of resiliency at low temperatures. The soft materials under consideration include various elastomers, plastics, and PTFE. They may be found in parts such as seat rings, seal or piston rings, packing, rotary shaft bearings and butterfly valve liners. Typical upper temperature limits for elastomers are in the $200-350^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}\\left(93-176^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$ range, and the general limit for PTFE is $450^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}\\left(232^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$.\n\nTemperature affects valve selection by excluding certain valves that do not have high- or low-temperature options. It also may have some effect on the valve's performance. For instance, going from PTFE to metal seals for high temperatures generally increases the shutoff leakage flow. Similarly, high temperature metal bearing sleeves in rotary valves impose more friction on the shaft than do PTFE bearings, so that the shaft cannot withstand as high a pressure-drop load at shutoff. Selection of valve packing is also based largely on service temperature.\n\n",

      "page_content": "\\section*{Flow Characteristic}\n\nThe next selection criterion, inherent flow characteristic, refers to the pattern in which the flow at constant pressure drop changes according to valve position.\n\nTypical characteristics are quick-opening, linear and equal-percentage. The choice of characteristic may have a strong influence on the stability or controllability of the process (see Table 1-3), since it represents the change of valve gain relative to travel.\n\nMost control valves are carefully \"characterized\" by means of contours on a plug, cage, or ball ele-\n\n[Figure figure_1_10]\nment. Some valves are available in a variety of characteristics to suit the application, while others offer little or no choice. To quantitatively determine the best flow characteristic for a given application, a dynamic analysis of the control loop can be performed.\n\nThe accompanying drawing illustrates typical flow characteristic curves (Figure 1-10). The quick opening flow characteristic provides for maximum change in flow rate at low valve travels with a fairly linear relationship. Additional increases in valve travel give sharply reduced changes in flow rate, and when the valve plug nears the wide open position, the change in flow rate approaches zero. In a control valve, the quick opening valve plug is used primarily for on-off service.\n\nThe linear flow characteristic curve shows that the flow rate is directly proportional to the valve travel. This proportional relationship produces a characteristic with a constant slope so that, with constant pressure drop, the valve gain will be the same at all flows. The linear valve plug is commonly specified for liquid level control and for certain flow control applications requiring constant gain.\n\nIn the equal percentage flow characteristic, equal increments of valve travel produce equal percentage changes in the existing flow. The change in flow rate is always proportional to the flow rate just before the change in valve plug, disc, or ball position is made. When the valve plug, disc, or ball is near its seat and the flow is small, the change in\nflow rate will be small; with a large flow, the change in flow rate will be large.\n\nAn equal percentage flow characteristic is used generally on pressure control applications and on other applications where a large percentage of the pressure drop is normally absorbed by the system itself with only a relatively small percentage available at the control valve. Valves with an equal percentage characteristic should also be considered where highly varying pressure drop conditions could be expected.\n\n",

To a certain extent, a valve with one inherent flow characteristic can also be made to perform as though it had a different characteristic by using a nonlinear (i.e., characterized) posi-tioner-actuator combination. The limitation of this approach lies in the positioner's frequency response and phase lag compared to the characteristic frequency of the process.\n\nAlthough it is common practice to use a positioner on every valve application, each application should be reviewed carefully.\n\n",

At some point in the selection process, the valve's end connections must be considered with the question simply being whether the desired connection style is available in the valve being considered. Maintenance, weight, size, and service conditions all contribute to what end connection is used.\n\nIn some situations, this matter can limit the selection rather narrowly. For instance, if a piping specification calls for welded connections only, the choice usually is limited to sliding-stem valves.\n\nScrewed end connections, popular in small control valves, offer more economy than flanged ends. The threads usually specified are tapered female NPT (National Pipe Thread) on the valve body. They form a metal-to-metal seal by wedging over the mating male threads on the pipeline ends. This connection style is usually limited to valves not larger than NPS 2, and is not recommended for elevated temperature service.\n\nValve maintenance might be complicated by screwed end connections if it is necessary to take the body out of the pipeline. Screwed connections require breaking a flanged joint or union connection to permit unscrewing the valve body from the pipeline.\n\nFlanged end valves are easily removed from the piping and are suitable for use through the range\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_f30f0bb3b7b14bdf7722g-015.jpg?height=749&width=578&top_left_y=287&top_left_x=349)\n\nA7098 RING-TYPE JOINT\nFigure 1-11.

In service, shutoff leakage depends on many factors, including but not limited to, pressure drop, temperature, the condition of the sealing surfaces, and actuator force.\n\nSince shutoff ratings are based on standard test conditions that can be very different from service conditions, service leakage cannot be predicted accurately. However, the shutoff Class provides a good basis for comparison among valves of similar configuration. It is not uncommon for valve users to overestimate the shutoff class required.\n\nSince tight shutoff valves generally cost more both in initial cost as well as in later maintenance expense, serious consideration is warranted. Tight shutoff is particularly important in high-pressure valves, considering that leakage in these applications can lead to the ultimate destruction of the trim. Special precautions in seat material selection, seat preparation and seat load are necessary to ensure success.\n\n",

For very large lines, sliding-stem valves are more expensive than rotary types. On the other hand, for very small flows, a suitable rotary valve may not be available.\n\nIf future plans call for significantly larger flow, then a sliding-stem valve with replaceable restricted trim may be the answer. The trim can be changed to full size trim to accommodate higher flow rates at less cost than replacing the entire valve body assembly.\n\nRotary style products generally have much higher maximum capacity than sliding-stem valves for a given body size. This fact makes rotary products attractive in applications where the pressure drop available is rather small. However, it is of little or no advantage in high-pressure drop applications such as pressure regulation or letdown.\n\n",

      "page_content": "\\section*{Conclusion}\n\nWe may simplify the process of selection as follows:\n\nFor most general applications, it makes sense both economically as well as technically to use sliding-stem valves for lower flow ranges, ball valves for intermediate capacities, and high performance butterfly valves for the very largest required flows.\n\nFor sizes less than NPS 3, general-purpose slid-ing-stem valves provide an exceptional value. For a minimal price premium over rotary products, they offer unparalleled performance, flexibility and service life. In NPS 3 size and larger, the premium for these devices over rotary products is warranted. For severe service applications the most frequently used and often the only available product is the sliding-stem valve.\n\nApplications ranging from NPS 4 to NPS 6 are best served by such transitional valve styles as the eccentric plug valve or the ball valve. These products have minimal body material and therefore lower cost. They also offer higher capacity levels than globe designs.\n\nIn sizes NPS 8 and larger, applications tend to have lower pressures and pressure drops than in smaller valve sizes. This gives rise to the possibility of using high-performance butterfly valves. These valves are economical, can offer tight shutoff as well as provide good control capability, not to mention capacity benefits well beyond those of globe and high-performance rotary valves.\n\nSpecial considerations may require out of the ordinary valve solutions. There are valve designs and special trims available to handle high noise applications, cavitation, high pressure, high temperature and combinations of these conditions.\n\nAfter going through all the criteria for a given application, the selection process may point to several types of valves. From there on, selection becomes a matter of price versus capability as discussed here, coupled with the inevitable personal and institutional preferences. Since no single control valve package is cost-effective over the full range of applications, it is important to keep an open mind to alternative choices.\n\n[Table table_1_2]\n\n[Table table_1_3]\n\n",

      "page_content": "\\section*{Packing Materials and Systems}\n\nThis section provides information and insight to help in selection of packing systems. Application guidelines for each packing selection have been developed to aid in the packing selection process. These guidelines were developed based on test results of various packing systems conducted in Fisher's technical center. Exceeding these guidelines may result in reduced service life.\n\nThe ratings for these systems do not affect the valve pressure/temperature class rating. Traditional valve selection entails selecting a valve design based on pressure and temperature capabilities, flow characteristics, and material compatibility. An additional factor-packing selection-is now a critical factor in the valve selection process.\n\nProper packing selection is being driven in the United States by the Clean Air Act Amendments, subsequent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, and our customers' increasing concern for improved packing performance (less maintenance and longer service life.)\n\nIn recent years, packing selection has been primarily based on process temperature; that is, PTFE was selected for temperatures below $450^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$ ( $232^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ), and graphite was selected for temperatures above $450^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}\\left(232^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$. Considerations now include the effect of packing friction on process control, hysteresis, seal quality, and cycle life.\n\nGiven the variety of process applications and installation conditions, these variables are difficult to quantify. A relative packing performance comparison can be made that provides an engineered approach to the packing selection process.\n\nClarification of trade names is required for proper understanding of the Table 1-5 shown in this publication. From the perspective of Fisher, ENVIROSEAL ${ }^{\\text {™ }}$ packing is defined as an advanced system using a \"compact\", live-load spring design. From a user perspective, ENVIRO-SEAL packing is most\ntypically thought of as an emission-reducing packing system; however, as shown in the following chart and graphs, it is highly useful in non-environmental applications as well.\n\nAlthough other packing materials and combinations of packing materials are available, the recommendations for nearly all applications are listed in Table 1-5. Simply select the appropriate packing based on pressure, temperature, leakage requirements, service life required, etc. Use the charts for additional guidance.\n\nThe packing selection guidelines in Table 1-5 present two categories of service conditions. The first category defines those packing systems designed for environmental or fugitive emission applications where 500 parts per million volume (ppmv) seal performance is required.\n\nThe second category defines application guidelines for non-environmental services. Depending on category requirements, different pressure/temperature guidelines have been established for the packing systems.\n\nIn addition, a given packing design has certain characteristics concerning seal performance, service life, and friction. The pressure and temperature guidelines and the relative comparison of these characteristics are defined in Table 1-5 and the supporting charts.\n\nKeep in mind that for non-environmental applications these are guidelines and are not intended as the ultimate limit. Exceeding the pressure guidelines for packing may be required; however, depending on how much the guidelines are exceeded, a reduction in total life span can be expected.\n\nWith flexible graphite packing this same logic applies to temperature. The recommended pressure I temperature limits for environmental applications using Fisher ENVIRO-SEAL packing cannot be exceeded without compromising sealing integrity.\n\n[Table table_1_5]\n\n",

The single most important issue is the potential for galvanic corrosion in valves in storage that have graphite packing system installed.\n\nFisher uses only the highest grades of base flexible graphite material that contain a non-metallic, inorganic, passivating inhibitor for galvanic corrosion resistance. All Fisher graphite packing systems (with the exception of nuclear applications) also include sacrificial zinc washers to prevent galvanic corrosion.\n\nHowever, even with these preventive measures, under humid conditions, in the presence of chlorides, with air or oxygen present, there is potential for galvanic corrosion of the valve stem. Because there are numerous variables associated with galvanic corrosion it is near impossible to predict when it may occur.\n\nThe best policy is to remove the packing if the valve is to be stored for a long period. This, however, may create a safety issue if someone were to use the valve not realizing that there was no packing in the valve. For this exact reason all Fisher valves are supplied with the packing installed.\n\n",

The ENVIRO-SEAL Graphite ULF arrangement can also be used with higher pressures up to 1500 psig (103 bar) and still maintain the 500 ppmv EPA leakage criteria.\n\nENVIRO-SEAL Graphite ULF packing systems were developed by utilizing the benefits of both PTFE and graphite components. These special packing systems provide the firesafe capability of graphite packing along with reduced friction advantages of PTFE packing. Thus, ENVIRO-SEAL Graphite ULF packing systems provide a lower friction, lower emission, fire-tested solution for applications with process temperatures up to $316^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ( $600^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$ ). ENVIRO-SEAL Graphite ULF packing systems were tested in accordance with API Standard 589, \"Fire Test Evaluation of Valve Stem Packing\", second edition. See Figure 1-14 for applications guidelines for 500 ppm service. Figure 1-17 shows the ENVIRO-SEAL Graphite ULF packing system.\n\n",

It is offered without PTFE washers for nuclear service where PTFE is prohibited and with PTFE washers for all other applications.\n\nThe primary advantage of the HIGH-SEAL packing system arrangement is the use of large Belleville springs, which can be calibrated with a load scale. The load scale provides a visual indication of packing load, making it easier to determine when additional torque might be required.\n\nHIGH-SEAL packing systems have a disadvantage, from an installation perspective.

For example, an ASME CL1500 (HP valve) application at 2000 psig and $200^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$ ( 137 bar and $93^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ) frequently required packing maintenance. The HIGH-SEAL packing system with PTFE washers was installed, significantly reducing maintenance requirements. This system is rated to 420 psig and $700^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$ (290 bar and $371^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ). The ENVIRO-SEAL packing system or compact Belleville spring arrangement is rated to 3000 psig and $700^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$ ( 20.7 bar and $371^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ).\n\nTable 1-5 shows that the braided graphite filament arrangement is limited to 1500 psig ( 103 bar). Due to its construction, braided graphite filament cannot sustain high packing stress levels. Over time, the braided graphite filament will break down and compress, and sealing force will be lost. Due to these characteristics, braided graphite filament will not provide the required seal performance for environmental services. The braided graphite filament arrangement is also susceptible to stick-slip action, which might cause process control deviations.\n\n",

However, experience shows that sealing the shaft on a rotary valve is less difficult than on sliding stem applications. The rotary motion does not tend to remove material from the packing box as does the sliding stem motion. Also, many of the rotary valve applications tend to be lower pressure applications than sliding stem valve services. As with sliding stem valves, the basic material recommendation for rotary valve packing is either PTFE or flexible graphite.\n\n",
